### What We Did:

#### System Architecture:
- Designed a robust architecture combining Sanity CMS as the backend for content management and Next.js for the frontend.
- Chose GROQ queries to fetch data efficiently from Sanity CMS.

#### Technology Stack:
- **Sanity CMS:** For managing and structuring content like food items and chef details.
- **Next.js:** To build the frontend with a focus on speed, SEO, and developer experience.
- **GROQ Queries:** For seamless data retrieval from Sanity.

#### Requirements Identified:
- Defined the necessary schemas for food and chef data.
- Outlined the API integration strategy to import and display data dynamically.

## DAY 3 - API Integration Report

### Goal:
To integrate APIs and migrate data into Sanity CMS, ensuring a functional marketplace backend while displaying data on the frontend.

### What We Did:

#### Data Migration:
- Used a custom migration script to fetch data from APIs and import it into Sanity CMS.
- Uploaded food and chef images dynamically to Sanity assets.
- Validated all data to ensure compatibility with Sanity schemas.

#### API Integration:
- **Integrated APIs:**
  - Food API: [https://sanity-nextjs-rouge.vercel.app/api/foods](https://sanity-nextjs-rouge.vercel.app/api/foods)
  - Chef API: [https://sanity-nextjs-rouge.vercel.app/api/chefs](https://sanity-nextjs-rouge.vercel.app/api/chefs)
- Fetched data using Axios and displayed it dynamically on the frontend using GROQ queries.

#### Frontend Integration:
- Successfully displayed imported data on the Next.js frontend using GROQ queries.
- Ensured proper rendering of food items and chef details with images, descriptions, and categories.
